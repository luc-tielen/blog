This is the [souffle-haskell](https://github.com/luc-tielen/souffle-haskell)
talk I gave at the
[Berlin FP meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Functional-Programming-Group).

Souffle-haskell is a Haskell library that provides bindings for the Souffle
language. Souffle is a Datalog variant that allows rapid prototyping of complex
analyses in a high-level logic language. With souffle-haskell, it is now
possible to combine the strengths of both Haskell and Datalog in order to solve
complex problems easily.

In this talk, I start with a short introduction of how I came about
creating souffle-haskell. Afterwards, I explain how Haskell and Souffle
can work together seamlessly and how this functionality is exposed in the
library. Finally, I showcase some of the cool things you can build using
the combination of Souffle and Haskell.
