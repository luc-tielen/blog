In this video, I build a typesystem + interpreter from scratch for a simple
language with integers and booleans. Initially I try to do this using algebraic
data types, but I quickly run into problems because of limitations of the
typesystem. Then I try another approach using GADTs (generalized algebraic data
types) and everything smoothly falls into place.
